    - Performance: measured in terms of response time for a given screen transaction per user. In addition to response time, performance can also be measured in transaction throughput, which is the number of transactions in a given time period, usually one second.  
    
    - Scalability: is the ability to support the required quality of service as the system load increases without changing the system. A system can be considered scalable if, as the load increases, the system still responds within the acceptable limits.  
    
    - Reliability: ensures the integrity and consistency of the application and all its transactions. As the load increases on your system, your system must continue to process requests and handle transactions as accurately as it did before the load increased. Reliability can have a negative impact on scalability.  
    
    - Availability: ensures that a service/resource is always accessible. Reliability can contribute to availability, but availability can be achieved even if components fail (24x7) 
    
    - Extensibility: is the ability to add additional functionality or modify existing functionality without impacting existing system functionality.  
    
    - Maintainability: is the ability to correct flaws in the existing functionality without impacting other components of the system.  
    
    - Manageability: is the ability to manage the system to ensure the continued health of a system with respect to scalability, reliability, availability, performance, and security.  
    
    - Security: is the ability to ensure that the system cannot be compromised. Security is by far the most difficult systemic quality to address. Security includes not only issues of confidentiality and integrity, but also relates to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that impact availability.
